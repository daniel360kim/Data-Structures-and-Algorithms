# Chapter 3
## Arrays, Linked Lists, and Recursion
This chapter covers using arrays, singly linked lists, double linked lists, circular lists, and recursion. I created template classes for each data structure and several examples and exercises to learn recursion.

Many recursion exercises used can be found [here](https://tildesites.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs107/spring05/recursion.html)
